# Little Red Riding Hood

A common child bed time story we used to listen to our morher or watch it as a movie
on our tv.

In my game Litte red riding hood comes with an extra story. She needs
to get to ther grandmother's house, but also an extra character will need
to go through a different maze to get to her great-grandmother's house, evading the wolves too.

- While trying to not collide with the wolves you will need to figure out how to
find your way to grandmother's house since the map will be revealing while you
walk through it.
